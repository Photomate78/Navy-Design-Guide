## Design Methods

### Hierarchical

#### Color 

Color indicates which elements are interactive, how they relate to other elements, and their level of prominence. Important elements should stand out the most.  

When using color it should be applied purposefully as it can convey meaning in multiple ways, such as relationships between elements and degrees of hierarchy. 

It needs be used consistently, so that certain colors always mean the same thing, even if the context changes. Attention should also be given to colors with local or cultural significance. 

For example, alerts are colored red.

#### Information

Information is categorized, well-thought, distinct, and accurate.

### Legibility

#### Color

Text and important elements, like icons, should meet legibility standards when appearing on colored backgrounds, across all screen and device types. 
Color should also be applied throughout a UI consistently and be compatible with the brand it represents.

#### Readability

All content should be visible while the surface morphs, without clipping content.

#### Subtlety

Use color in subtle ways, whether that means conveying sophistication, emphasizing content or context, or suiting content in some other way. When using color with subtlety, ensure that interactive areas and state changes remain identifiable and easily seen.
