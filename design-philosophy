## Design Philosophy

### Design with Empathy

Understand our users and end users better than they understand themselves.

### Content is King

A person’s focus should be on the content, not on the UI. Help people work without interference.

### Accessible Design is Good Design

Design should be usable on all devices by all of the people in all situations. Design is simple, touch friendly and clear and aims for AA accessibility.

### Data informs Design

“One accurate measurement is worth more than a thousand expert opinions.” 
– Rear Admiral and Computer Scientist, Grace Hopper 
  (Computer Science Pioneer)

### Good Design works for Everyone, Daily

Design solves an important human problem.

### Good Design builds Long-Term Relationships

We value the familiarity and trust placed in us. We acknowledge the Navy heritage of iconic design and history with subtle references.  We believe in active caring, and we recognize the need to speak to everyone and the individual.
