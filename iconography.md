### Silhouette
The silhouette or shape of the iconography needs to be clear, readable, and recongizable.  It is important that the visual design of the iconicity is accurate and well defined.  Iconicity is the relationship of resemblance or similarity between the "form" and its "meaning".  An iconic sign is a form that resembles its meaning.  The opposite of iconicity is arbitrariness.

Use white to provide appropriate negative space, and to enhance visual articulation when appropriate, also necessary.

### Labeling
To prevent possible ambiguity that almost all icons face, a text label must be present alongside an icon to clarify its meaning in that particular context.
