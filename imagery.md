## Imagery

### Light

Natural light sources ensure images have an authentic, unembellished look. The composition and narrative is integrated in the lighting situation and is not artificially highlighted.  Light and Shade creates accents in the atmospheric perspective while it can still be used as stylistic devices to tell stories or support ideas.

### Definition and Blur

The interplay of definition and blur is put to selective use to create a focus and a natural look.  In this way, the attention is drawn to a specific idea or thought.  Supporting elements can be out of focus if it supports the motif.
