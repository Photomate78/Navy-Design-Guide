### Minimum Display Dimensions

A 150px by 100px photo has little impact and conveys minimal
information. Photos should always be displayed with dimensions
of at least **225px by 150px** for teasers or previews, such as
those used in lists of news stories, and at least **300px by
200px** when used in a page’s main content, as those same news
story photos would be in each story’s full page view.

### Choosing a hero image

Hero images should make an impact, engaging the user and setting
the emotional tone for the page, but they shouldn’t overpower
the content elements they support (navbar, headings, etc.)  When
selecting a hero image for a page, pay attention to both the
appearance of the image and its composition.

#### Appearance

When considering the appearance of a hero image, follow our
exisiting brand guidelines:

> The image treatment is high contrast and slightly desaturated
> with a subtle steel gray overlay to give all the images a
> cinematic tone.

> All photography should feel cinematic, allowing each photo
> to tell its own story. Each image should have a single focus,
> using people as the primary subject as much as possible.

Equipment such as ships and other craft may also be used as the
primary subject.

Some colors don't pair well with our brand colors. Avoid images
with large areas of clashing color.

#### Composition

When considering the composition of a prospective hero image,
avoid images with focal areas in the top third or left third of
the image. These areas should be reserved for the page header
and featured content headings, respectively.
