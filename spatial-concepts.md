## Spatial Concepts

### Predictable
UIs should use intuitive and predictable layouts, with consistent UI regions and spatial organization.

Spatial relationships are important, and consistency is comfortable.

### Congruent
Layouts should use a consistent grid, keylines, and padding.

### Delightful
The layout assists with comprehension and helps convey a clear message.

### Responsive
Layouts are adaptive and react to input from the user, device, and screen elements.
