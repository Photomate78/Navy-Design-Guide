### Typefaces

The Roboto type family was first produced by Google for use as
the system font for the mobile-oriented operating system Android,
and later expanded to its web services. We use two Roboto
typefaces, Roboto and Roboto Slab, on navy.mil for several
reasons:

* Existing navy.com branding uses both
* As the family was designed for the screen and to be legible at
small sizes, it works well in the browser
* Roboto and Roboto Slab are different enough to create strong
contrast when used together.

  <div class="specimen__name">Roboto <span class="specimen__variation">Regular</span></div>
  <div class="specimen__example">
    The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="specimen specimen--roboto-slab-bold">
  <div class="specimen__name">Roboto Slab <span class="specimen__variation">Bold</span></div>
  <div class="specimen__example">
    The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
  </div>
</div>

#### Files

#### Web Font Usage

As font files are often among the largest assets served in
response to a page request, they are a critical target for
optimization. We use Google Fonts to dynamically load and serve
font files because it provides an efficient compression and
caching system.
